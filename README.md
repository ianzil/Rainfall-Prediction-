# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Rainfall prediction is a crucial yet challenging task that can help mitigate risks associated with extreme weather conditions. This project implements various machine learning models to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data from major cities in Australia.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comes from the **Australian Bureau of Meteorology**. It contains daily weather observations, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological factors.

## Features & Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rainfall-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `project final.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## Results

The project evaluates different models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected for final predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Use deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Implement real-time weather data fetching.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
